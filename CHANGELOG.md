## History

### 22.04.2024

### 02.12.2022

* Update the repository with the newest CMIP6 models and ensemble members.

### 26.10.2022

* Update the repository with the newest CMIP6 models and ensemble members.

### 11.03.2021

* Moved history to own file.

### 19.01.2021

* CMIP5: removed CESM1-CAM5-1-FV2 (r1i1p1, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) because of a missing month in the data. Found two more models with changes du to the weighting with "areacella" - CCSM4 (r1i1p1, RCP85) and CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 (r4i1p1, RCP45). They were previously missed because the grid of the weights and the data does not exactly align.

* CMIP6: added EC-Earth3-CC (r1i1p1f1, several SSPs)

### 13.01.2021

* Recomputed all models & used areacella as area-weights (instead of the cosine of the latitude). This lead to differences for some models between the old numbers and the new ones. See the tables below:

 <sup>\*</sup>at high latitudes

* Removed EC-EARTH (r3i1p1, RCP4.5 & RCP8.5) due to missing years in the data.

### 11.12.2020
 * Add Models EC-Earth3-Veg-LR, TaiESM1, E3SM-1-1 (new scenarios) CMIP6 models. Add ensemble members for CNRM-ESM2-1, EC-Earth3-Veg-LR, TaiESM1, and E3SM-1-1.

### 23.11.2020
 * Add IITM-ESM, EC-Earth3-AerChem, TaiESM1 (new scenarios) CMIP6 models. Add ensemble members for ACCESS-ESM1-5, FGOALS-g3, CNRM-ESM2-1, GISS-E2-1-G.

### 08.10.2020
 * Add CMCC-CM2-SR5, KIOST-ESM, and TaiESM1 CMIP6 models. Also more ensemble members for GISS-E2-1-G, MIROC6, and UKESM1-0-LL.

### 05.10.2020
 * Add the inofficial (not-cmorized, not on ESGF) EC-EARTH r3i1p1 ensemble (source: http://ensemblesrt3.dmi.dk/data/CMIP5/r3i1p1/).

### 01.10.2020
 * Adding MIROC5 to CMIP5 again (per request).

### 21.09.2020
 * Added the start years of all models starting after 1850.

### 18.09.2020
 * added warming level years w.r.t. 1850-1900 for CMIP5 including models starting *after* 1850 (no_bounds_check)
 * added warming level years w.r.t. 1861-1900 for CMIP5 (because a some models only start after 1850)
 * Some models starting after 1850 were missing from the 1995-2014-files because they were already filtered when loading the data
   (and not when calculating the anomaly)
 * Added the reference period to the header of the files

### 17.09.2020
 * Added all yml and csv files for all avaliable ensemble members in cmip5_all_ens and cmip6_all_ens.

### 15.09.2020
 * Note, the following CMIP5 models are not included because they start after 1850: GFDL-CM3 (1860), GFDL-ESM2G (1861), GFDL-ESM2M (1861), HadGEM2-AO (1860), HadGEM2-CC (1859), HadGEM2-ES (1859), and MRI-ESM1 (1851).

### 27.07.2020

 * Added acknowledgment, licensing and list of CMIP5 models.

### 09.06.2020

### 03.06.2020
 * Removed BCC-ESM1 (SSP3-7.0) and MPI-ESM-1-2-HAM (SSP3-7.0) from the list of CMIP6 models because the simulations end in 2055.
 * Added five new CMIP6 models (CIESM, CNRM-CM6-1-HR, GISS-E2-1-G, KACE-1-0-G, NorESM2-MM).

### 03.02.2020
 * Added new models from the CMIP6 archive. A total of 16 models were added.
 * Removed MIROC5, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESMn from the list of CMIP5 models due to a spurious temperature jump in the Western United States.

### 23.12.2019

 * added warming level years with respect to 1995-2014
